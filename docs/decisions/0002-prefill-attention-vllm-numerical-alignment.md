# ADR-0002: Prefill attention aligned to the vLLM numerical class (split-P tensor route)

Decision state: accepted, by explicit project-owner instruction
(2026-09-21: "可以按照vllm的生产部署对齐,但是一定要做好记录").

## Context

The P40000/O16 production prefill spent 663.7 s because the dispatch predicate
`use_bulk_causal_gqa_group_q64_prefill` restricted the 6.6x-faster WMMA tensor
kernel to `first_position in {0, 512}`, sending ~74 of 76 prefill chunks to the
scalar FP32-probability kernel (79.6% of prefill time).

A real-model A/B proved that simply widening the predicate diverged from the
scalar oracle from token 0. The P513 three-way oracle on real layer-3
activations proved the in-tree FlashInfer kernel is not more accurate than the
GroupQ64 kernel: all BF16-probability tensor routes share the same numerical
class (nrmse floor ~5.4e-4 vs the scalar FP32-probability oracle).

The split-P technique (P = P_hi + P_lo, two WMMA mma into the same FP32
accumulator, FP32 probability sum for the denominator) was verified
synthetically (22x nrmse improvement, no speed loss) and on real data
(logsumexp error reduced 12x, 0.0633 -> 0.00517).

The top-5 logit comparison on the pinned P40000 prompt established the
divergence mechanism: the scalar oracle's own BF16 logits are an **exact tie**
at token 0 (760 = 16.25 and 27775 = 16.25, top-2 margin = 0.0). The
production `bf16_greedy_argmax_kernel` breaks ties by lowest index, so the
oracle selects 760. Any BF16-input tensor route perturbs the underlying FP32
values enough to cross the zero margin and flip the argmax to 27775. This is a
property of the model and prompt at this precision class, not a fixable bug:
no BF16-input tensor-core route can guarantee token-identical greedy output
against the FP32-probability scalar oracle on prompts with exact BF16 ties.

## Decision

1. The production prefill attention numerical contract is aligned to the
   vLLM/FlashInfer production deployment class: BF16-probability tensor-core
   attention. Token-identical reproduction of the historical scalar FP32
   oracle is no longer a production requirement; prompts whose BF16 logits
   contain exact top-k ties may produce different (equally valid) greedy
   tokens.
2. The widened dispatch predicate routes all legal C2..C512 prefill chunks to
   the grouped-Q64 tensor kernel with split-P probability
   (P_hi + P_lo, two WMMA mma, FP32 denominator), which captures ~16-bit
   probability precision at no measured speed cost.
3. The historical scalar FP32-probability kernel remains in the tree as the
   reference oracle for accuracy measurement and as the non-tensor fallback
   for single-token and over-capacity shapes.
4. The accepted real-API evidence for this decision is the pinned P40000/O16
   request on the split-P build: pure prefill wall 219.8 s (vs 663.7 s
   scalar, ~3.0x), 16 generated tokens, coherent output, finish_reason
   length. The generated text differs from the scalar-oracle text from token
   0 due to the documented exact-tie mechanism; both outputs are coherent.
5. Evidence is retained in the ignored workspace
   `.q3x-work/attention-bench/real-model-accuracy-20260920/` (capture A/B,
   top-5 comparison, P513 oracle) and
   `.q3x-work/attention-bench/real-model-accuracy-20260920/api-splitp-20260921/`
   (real API preflight, stream events, result).
6. This decision does not amend the constitutional accuracy contract for
   decode, GDN, or projection paths; it amends only the prefill full-attention
   numerical class. Release qualification remains separately required.

## Consequences

- Prefill speed improves ~3x on the pinned P40000/O16 workload; the 2 s
  prefill target remains open and requires the whole-prompt large-grid
  architecture (FLOP floor 1.14 s).
- Any downstream consumer that pinned the historical scalar-oracle output on
  tie-prone prompts must re-baseline.
- The synthetic accuracy gate (`q3x_decode_ops_cuda_test`) now passes for all
  legal C2..C512 shapes with split-P (nrmse <= 1.7e-4, gate 0.005).
