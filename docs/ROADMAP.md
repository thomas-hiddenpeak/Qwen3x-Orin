# Qwen3x-Orin active delivery roadmap

This roadmap contains only unfinished delivery slices and their exit criteria.
It does not own current performance numbers, experiment history, subsystem
design, or evidence. Those facts belong to Current Status, the SDD, subsystem
contracts, and immutable evidence respectively.

## Ordering rule

Work is ordered from the final runner boundary inward:

```text
callable product API
  -> exact request/capacity contract
  -> attested release and execution plan
  -> target-length Prefill and Decode budgets
  -> subsystem architecture candidates
  -> scoped local optimization work packages
  -> kernels, layouts, and local mechanisms
```

A local mechanism does not enter this roadmap independently. It appears only
as a required mutation inside a named architecture candidate selected by an
API-visible product constraint. Local work-package rules stop at that package;
they cannot reorder the delivery slices below.

Inside every Prefill architecture candidate, the work order is also fixed:

```text
real-number equivalence and live graph
  -> finite-precision operands, reduction tree, rounding and state boundaries
  -> production observables, buffer/control-state lifetime and alias ownership
  -> engineering map to SM87 residency, ownership, pipeline and synchronization
```

The
[`PREFILL_MATHEMATICAL_EQUIVALENCE_LEDGER.md`](PREFILL_MATHEMATICAL_EQUIVALENCE_LEDGER.md)
owns the proof classes. A local kernel parameter cannot skip or retroactively
justify an earlier step.

## Locked outcome

The owner-set constraints are normative in the
[Constitution](ENGINEERING_CONSTITUTION.md#8-locked-business-targets), and the
exact external contract is owned by the
[system SDD](SDD.md#2-end-state-product-contract). This roadmap sequences the
unfinished work needed to satisfy them; it neither copies nor recalibrates
the targets. Current support and gaps are reported only in Current Status.

## P0. Documentation control plane

Purpose: preserve project intent and system truth across agents, branches, and
context compaction before further architecture work.

Remaining deliverable:

- carry the documentation-control commit into every actual development
  baseline, because an `AGENTS.md` in another linked worktree is not a Codex
  entry point for a session started elsewhere.

Exit criteria:

- every tracked Markdown file is classified;
- the `document_control` host test rejects registry, required-header,
  identity, reciprocal-supersession, and local-link drift;
- every active task can trace product constraint -> budget -> architecture
  candidate -> local work package -> API return point;
- no active document calls a historical component proxy the product target;
- README, SDD, Current Status, Roadmap, policies, contracts, and evidence each
  have one non-overlapping truth owner.

## P1. Product API and target-capacity boundary

Purpose: make the final workload executable and observable before selecting a
performance architecture. This phase may use one pinned exact development
artifact; it does not call that artifact a release candidate.

Deliverables:

- a versioned OpenAI-compatible production API contract distinct from the
  loopback evaluation adapter;
- exact definitions for the 40K, 60K, and approximately 130K token witnesses,
  including maximum output tokens and `prompt + output - 1` capacity;
- capacity admission before partial execution and no silent truncation;
- versioned memory profiles for each witness;
- request and startup state machines defined by the SDD;
- streaming first-token, usage, error, overload, disconnect, cancellation, and
  shutdown semantics;
- structured per-request observability for queue, tokenize, admission, pure
  Prefill, final prompt/logits, first commit, first byte, Decode, and total;
- one named exact measurement artifact and route identity that excludes MTP,
  approximate research routes, cuBLASLt, and undeclared fallbacks while the
  release packaging contract is still being implemented.

Exit criteria:

- all target witnesses are accepted or rejected before execution with an exact
  reason;
- successful requests prove full prompt consumption and complete output
  accounting;
- target-length cold/no-cache API smoke tests run through the pinned exact
  measurement artifact without claiming release qualification;
- the evaluation adapter and product trust boundary cannot be confused in
  documentation or telemetry.

## P2. Canonical exact release artifact

Purpose: package the now-executable product boundary into one binary whose
measured route is the route users receive.

Deliverables:

- a `BUILD_TESTING=OFF` release profile;
- no test-only admission flag or environment-variable route composition;
- authenticated checkpoint, executable, kernel ABI, sidecar, workspace, and
  execution-plan identities;
- explicit `DeploymentPlan`, `PrefillExecutionPlan`, `DecodeExecutionPlan`,
  and `RequestMemoryPlan` boundaries;
- startup route warmup and attestation;
- fail-closed startup on plan, artifact, capacity, workspace, or route mismatch;
- proof that MTP, approximate research routes, cuBLASLt, and unintended
  fallbacks are unreachable from the release artifact.

Exit criteria:

- one documented command builds the release with testing disabled;
- the server becomes ready only after plan and route attestation;
- target-length API smoke tests and deterministic exact-output oracles use the
  same executable that will enter external performance selection;
- health/telemetry identifies the release and route without relying on an
  experiment harness.

## P3. Exact Prefill parity, then specialization advantage — paused

Purpose: preserve the useful-vLLM-parity and specialization-advantage outcome
while Prefill performance work is paused.

Status: **paused by project-owner direction on 2026-08-20**. The pause changes
delivery scheduling only. It does not amend the Constitution's accuracy,
non-MTP, reference-only cuBLASLt, 40K/60K/approximately-130K capacity, or
latency targets. There is no active Prefill architecture candidate or local
optimization work package on the delivery mainline. P1/P2 and later delivery
slices retain their existing dependency and exit contracts; nothing in this
section authorizes a Prefill performance run, profiler capture, local scan,
default-route change, or production promotion while the pause remains.

### Paused recovery boundary

The exact recovery anchor is
`archive/v4-construction-ownership-20260820@f3545240075651eaa54a5bea6c0f15ee9dfd9a3e`.
It is an explicitly incomplete, default-off architecture foundation/local work
package, not a Constitution-defined runnable `architecture_candidate`, and it
is neither contained in nor selected by this mainline. The archive's
schema-v5 closeout source remains `status=fail` because the 419,917,824-byte
post-destruction free-memory gap exceeds the fixed 33,554,432-byte tolerance.
The later holder-free post-exit preflight is not a Jetson `nvmap`
`no_owner_leak` classification. The archive grants no normal request
execution, numerical, generation, API, timing, performance, release, or
production authority.

Resume only after a new explicit project-owner direction. Start from the
then-current mainline and use the archive as a source/evidence reference; do
not merge it wholesale or infer mainline capability from branch-local tests.
The frozen first sequence is:

1. fixed normal 64-layer by five-C8000-panel loop plus the Embedding edge and
   complete failure/cancellation rollback;
2. exact epoch-five B-to-A/FinalPublish/sequence fence, successful-request
   reuse, and independent Control events around canonical
   `PrefillStateCommitted`;
3. preserve and reconcile the strict lifetime failure if formal lifecycle
   acceptance is needed, then run the remaining proportional real-checkpoint
   numerical gates; and
4. only then expose one default-off OpenAI P40 route and run one clean-host
   direction witness. A negative or small result reopens the global dataflow,
   never a local parameter scan.

### Promotion and stop gates

These gates remain resume-time exit criteria; they do not make P3 or any
candidate active.

Before CUDA mapping, the candidate records its real-number equations,
finite-precision reduction/publication/state boundaries,
production-observable live graph, buffer/control-state lifetime and alias
ownership, communication lower bound, and intended operand residence/reuse.
The stable requirements are owned by the
[Prefill subsystem SDD](PREFILL_ARCHITECTURE_RESET.md#8-stable-implementation-constraints).

A P40 direction is retained locally only under the real-model performance
policy. It advances to correctness and statistical qualification only after a
material positive whole-API result. A negative complete composition closes its
own version after at most one bounded causal profile. No P60, P130, EvalScope
dataset matrix, or low-yield tile/stage/cache scan may displace that return
point. Only a competitive, accuracy-admissible P40 result unlocks P60 and then
the approximately-130K witness.

Every candidate must answer:

- how prompt spans and layers are traversed without repeated dead work;
- where weights, scales, activations, KV, recurrent state, and scratch remain
  resident over their useful lifetimes;
- how Gate/Up, Down, FP8 projection, Attention, and GDN receive shape-specific
  ownership while composing in natural model order;
- which exact dependency justifies every stream, event, buffer, and overlap;
- how 40K, 60K, and approximately 130K capacities fit without request-time
  allocation growth or silent truncation; and
- which offline-selected tactics enter the authenticated release plan.

Exit criteria, in order:

- same-workload vLLM parity on the shortest target witness;
- no regression on longer target witnesses, accuracy, Decode, or memory;
- the 40K--60K and approximately 130K locked SLOs; and
- a measured specialization advantage over the matched general engine.

P513, component timings, NSys, and NCU remain attribution tools. They do not
replace these exits.

## P4. Accuracy, stability, and release qualification

Purpose: turn a positive architecture into a deliverable release.

Deliverables:

- pinned deterministic token/logit/state oracles;
- parseable public capability evaluation with no output truncation;
- independent-process mirrored performance repetitions and tail latency;
- long-output, cancellation, malformed-request, OOM, and shutdown stability;
- resource-preflight, temperature, clocks, memory, artifact, corpus, raw
  EvalScope, server-log, and route evidence in one bundle;
- release installation and startup documentation from a clean checkout.

Exit criteria:

- hard accuracy and API constraints pass before performance is considered;
- all release evidence is reproducible from tracked commands and retained raw
  artifacts;
- a fresh process reaches attested ready state and serves every declared
  capacity profile without hidden tuning or fallback.

## P5. Startup and operational hardening

This slice follows, rather than precedes, a viable target-length runner unless
startup behavior directly blocks its deployment contract.

- authenticate and load a static AOT deployment plan;
- bound cold load, sidecar preparation, memory peak, and warmup;
- remove request-path compilation, autotuning, repacking, and workspace growth;
- add packaging, service supervision, telemetry retention, and upgrade/rollback
  procedures.

## P6. Additional model and feature families

Only after the dense 27B runner clears the product gates:

1. Qwen3.5/Qwen3.6 35B-A3B MoE on a separately pinned checkpoint and SDD
   extension;
2. continuous batching or multi-request service where a real product workload
   selects it;
3. MTP, speculative decoding, vision, or other features under explicit new
   product contracts.

MTP remains ineligible to satisfy the current Prefill or Decode target.

## Work-package admission template

The admission fields and lifecycle are owned by the
[system SDD](SDD.md#7-local-work-package-boundary) and the
[real-model performance policy](REAL_MODEL_PERFORMANCE_POLICY.md#named-local-optimization-work-packages).
Each active phase above records only its concrete package instance and return
gate; this roadmap does not maintain a second generic template.

## Historical record

The pre-SDD component-first and append-only roadmap is retained unchanged in
[`ROADMAP_LEGACY.md`](ROADMAP_LEGACY.md). Its completed milestones and
measurements remain valid only for their recorded protocols. They do not own
current status, priority, production eligibility, or terminal targets.
